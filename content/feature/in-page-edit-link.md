Changelog:

* Each post is now updated with an `article-section` containing dynamic link to corresponding github file.

Tools:

* Hugo - this is a hugo implementation of the solution
* Github - utilizes the raw edit feature of github repositories; authentication, diffs and content-management is handled by github.
