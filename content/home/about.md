# #humblebrag

CSITauthority is a blog dedicated towards bringing CSIT related stuff to real CSIT-studying students. We believe in keeping the gimmick down. We provide Notes, PDFs, eBooks, Software, Past Questions, Model Questions, and all those little things that students generally get to have at the end of a tiresome semester.

This started back in 2015 on the 3rd of Feb Tuesday around midnight with only one person and on March 18th 2016, we finally have a semblance of a team. With 2017, we've decided to do something radical. CSITauthority goes to github; We're giving power back to the people.
